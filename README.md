# This is a WIP and will change a lot

## The working file is the .ipynb at the moment as I got tired of creating new files for minor updates

- The notebook allows for prototyping easily (when there isn't as much in there as there is now lol)
  - The notebook has the main gui application that allows for video recording
  - After that there is a section to create a csv of points for model training
  - Then there is a training function
  - Lastly there is a test function
    - The md sections make it easier to find the different application sections
    - There are multiple code sections filled with the same things, just minor tweaks; the md sections don't really add much for these though
